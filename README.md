# strage_emails

These two are really weird emails that I received on April 1st, 2012 and October,12th, 2012, from an unknown sender 233558938299@dysgo.org. The email passed by Google's spam filters and found its way directly into my inbox. 
A tiny bit of research into the email address shows that people believe this to be a mass email sent periodically by a paranoid schizophrenic man from Japan. The email consisted only of the following 100 images arranged in this order. The text of the last image of the first email can be found at the end. It can even be found in wikileak's syria files.

> Dear world community,
> 
> The emperors in Japan have been a proxy or replica of me. I am a true emperor in Japan named Jesus and may have another names in places (in Iran too). All the laws are based on me. I am finding that we are suffering from unusable software. If you do not understand by yourself, I must let you know the truth gradually. I have decided to restore the true collaborative governance with you.
> 
> If you know the Ten Commandments is scalable, follow it and then I approve it. It is the minimum governance. For example, neighbor is an unit nearby. If you have a common sense, you should know better. Difficult? We are being surrounded by Agent Smith. Let us start rebooting.
> 
> We think that a better value exchanging system is needed. Because many people are suffering from it. Let us adjust the current system towards new system with no debt and no interest rates. If not possible or in parallel people can start to make the system from the ground up. I approve it. And let us start fleshly.
> 
> Making the exchanging system based on metals is a bad idea. And it should be based on stone age software. Because bronze age had been an age of destruction. Software in the bronze age is unusable. Let us recall the software of stone age. And we will start the system cleanly.
> 
> Israel, I do not think Iran is your enemy. And I do not think Israel is the enemy of Iran. It seems that Iran is just intolerant about bad manner around you. Do you want to see the inside of pants in Iran? If you see it you may have to be slaves of slaves. And Japan is not the new Jerusalem. Stone and Tree is scalable for people.
> 
> Japan (and the world) has a system like IDS (Intrusion Detection System) or redundant Honeypot (a trap set to detect, deflect, or in some manner counteract attempts at unauthorized use of information systems). It is sad that the first emperor is Jinmu and Japan starts at BC 660 or Japan starts at Taika Reforms in the year 645. They are all Honeypot.
> 
> It has been something like a process in a virtual machine. As it has been all Honeypot the system should be rebooted. Rebooting is a restoration of the world based on stone age software. You can start it by yourself like walking or feeling. If you need help or collaboration, please put out something as a sign. We have been waiting for the time with you. Let us start happily.

> Thank you.
